* Course Description
Math 411 is the first part of a two-semester undergraduate abstract algebra
course. The focus of the course will be on studying /groups/. These are algebraic
structures that capture the notion of symmetry. Groups are ubiquitous in all
areas of mathematics (and the world around us). If you commit to this class,
you will master the essential concepts of group theory by the end of the
course.
** Prerequisites
*MATH 235* and either *CMPSCI 250* or *MATH 300*. In other words, we will need some
important concepts from linear algebra, and there will be an emphasis on proofs
and development of careful mathematical reasoning and writing.

** Main goals
- Survey the basic results and techniques in group theory.
- Explore key concrete examples and applications.
- Develop proof skills.

There will be three mid-term exams plus a final exam. Regular problem sets will
cover the theoretical part of the course.

My job as your instructor is to provide a framework and guide you in learning
the concepts and methods that comprise the material of the course. Most
learning will take place outside the classroom. Read the textbook carefully and
slowly before the lectures, working through examples and filling in omitted
steps. This is a challenging course with many new concepts and techniques.

** Learning objectives

1. To learn the fundamental examples of groups: finitely generated abelian
   groups, dihedral groups, symmetric and alternating groups, and matrix
   groups.
2. To learn the axiomatic definition of a group and how to use it to prove
   basic properties.
3. To learn the concepts of subgroups, cosets, quotients, and how to combine
   these to derive Lagrange’s theorem.
4. To learn the concepts of homomorphisms and isomorphisms and Noether's
   isomorphism theorems.
5. To understand the structure theorem of finitely generated abelian groups in
   terms of the Smith normal form of a matrix with integer coefficients.
6. To learn what it means for a group to act on a set as well as the
   natural actions of each of the fundamental examples.
