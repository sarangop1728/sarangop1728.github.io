There are several answers to this question, each one depending on your own interests and mathematical inclinations. Understanding (the statement, and then the proof of) the Weil conjectures is one of my own answers.<p>In this note I will talk about the Weil conjectures, and sketch a proof of the baby case of zero dimensional varieties (this is <a href=https://math.mit.edu/~poonen/papers/curves.pdf>Exercise 3.1 in Poonen's notes Curves.pdf</a>). I use the language of schemes, but mastering scheme theory is not necessary to understand the spirit of this note. Learn about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_of_a_ring>the spectrum of a ring</a> and the Zariski topology (Chapter 1 of Atiyah-MacDonald has great exercises) and come back; you will be able to calculate zeta functions of interesting rings!<blockquote><p>Of course, all errors (mathematical and literary) are my fault.

For every closed point $P \in X$, the residue field $$ \kappa(P) := \mathcal{O}_P/\mathfrak{m}_P$$ is a finite field.<p>To see why this is the case, choose an affine open neighborhood $\mathrm{Spec} ~ A$ of $P$ such that the corresponding ring map $\mathbb{Z} \to A$ gives $A$ the structure of a finitely generated abelian group. After composing with the natural projection $A \to A/P \cong \kappa(P)$, we get a map $\varphi: \mathbb{Z} \to \kappa(P)$. Consider the kernel of this homomorphism:<ul><li>If $\varphi$ is injective, then $\mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \kappa(P)$. Since $\kappa(P)$ is of finite type over both $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$, the <a href=https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00IS>Artin-Tate lemma</a> would imply that the rational numbers are a finitely generated abelian group; a contradiction.<li>Let $k := \mathbb{Z}/\ker{\varphi}$. Since $\kappa(P)$ is finitely generated as a $k$-algebra, <a href=https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00FS>Hilbert's Nullstellensatz</a> tells us that $\kappa(P)$ is also finitely generated as a $k$-vector space. Since $k$ is a finite field, we conclude that $\kappa(P)$ is also a finite field.</ul><p>We define the <strong>norm</strong> of a closed point $P \in X$ to be the size of it's residue field: $$NP : = |\kappa(P)|.$$<p>The <strong>zeta function</strong> of $X$ is defined as $$\zeta(X,s) := \zeta_X(s) := \prod_P \left( 1 - NP^{-s} \right)^{-1},$$ where the product ranges over all <em>closed</em> points $P$ in $X$ and $s$ denotes a complex variable. The interested reader can check that this possibly infinite (but always countable) product converges when the real part of $s$ is strictly greater than the dimension of $X$.<p>Before looking at some enlightening examples, we deduce two important properties from the definition.<ul><li><strong>(Property 1)</strong> If $X_{\text{red}}$ is the <a href=https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01IZ>reduction</a> of $X$, then $\zeta(X_{\text{red}}, s) = \zeta(X,s)$.<li><strong>(Property 2)</strong> Suppose we can write the set of closed points as a disjoint union $\overline{X} = \bigsqcup_i \overline{X}_i$ of the set of closed points of a collection of subschemes $X_i$. Then, the zeta function decomposes as a product $\zeta(X, s) = \prod_i \zeta(X_i, s)$.</ul><p>Property 1 follows from the fact that a scheme and its reduction have the same set of closed points. Property 2 follows directly from the definition of the zeta function as a product.<h2 id=some-examples>Some examples</h2><ul><li>Let $X$ be the spectrum of the finite field with $q^n$ elements. Since we have a unique closed point of norm $q^n$, we have that $$\zeta_{q^n}(s) := \zeta(\mathrm{Spec} ~ \mathbb{F}_{q^n}, s) = \dfrac{1}{1-q^{-ns}}.$$<li>When $X = \mathrm{Spec} ~ \mathbf{Z}$, the zeta function $\zeta_X(s)$ is the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function>Riemann zeta function</a>. Indeed, since $\overline{X} = \bigsqcup_p \overline{ \mathrm{Spec} ~ \mathbf{F}_{p}}$, and Property 2 yields \begin{equation} \zeta(\mathrm{Spec} ~ \mathbf{Z}, s) = \prod_p \left(\dfrac{1}{1-p^{-s}}\right) . \end{equation}<li>More generally, if $X$ is the spectrum of the ring of integers of a number field, then $\zeta(X,s)$ is the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_zeta_function>Dedekind zeta function</a>.<li>When $X = \mathbf{A}^1$ is the affine line over the finite field with $q$ elements, the closed points are in bijective correspondence with the monic irreducible polynomials in $\mathbf{F}_{q}[t]$. Using the fact that this ring is a unique factorization domain (and ignoring uniform convergence isues), we can rewrite $$\zeta(X, s) = 1 + \dfrac{q}{q^s} + \dfrac{q^2}{q^{2s}} + \dfrac{q^3}{q^{3s}} + \dots = \dfrac{1}{1-q^{1-s}},$$ by summing over monic polynomials of degree $d$, for every possible degree. Notice that $\zeta(\mathbf{A}^1,s) = \zeta_q(s-1)$.<li>When $X$ is the affine line over $\mathbf{Z}$, by writing $X$ as the disjoint union of its fibers over every prime $p$ (i.e., affine lines over $\mathbf{F}_p$), we get that $\zeta(X,s) = \zeta(s-1)$.<li>When $X = \mathbf{P}^1$ is the projective line over the integers, writing each fiber as $\mathbf{A}^1 \sqcup \infty$ and using Properties 1 and 2 yields $$\zeta(\mathbf{P}^1,s) = \prod_p \zeta_p(s)\zeta_p(s-1) = \zeta(s)\zeta(s-1).$$</ul><h1 id=varieties-over-finite-fields>Varieties over finite fields</h1><p>A <strong>variety</strong> over a field $k$ is a <a href=https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01KH>separated</a> scheme of finite type over $k$. Given a prime power $q$, we will consider varieties over the finite field $k = \mathbf{F}_q$. From this point forward, $X$ will denote a variety over $k$, and $k_r$ will denote the degree $r$ extension of $k$.<p>The first observation is that varieties over finite fields are of finite type over $\mathbf{Z}$. This follows from the fact that the morphism $\mathrm{Spec} ~ \mathbf{F}_q \to \mathrm{Spec} ~ \mathbf{Z}$ is of finite type, and the composition of morphisms of finite type is also of finite type.<p>The second observation is that for every closed point $P$ in $X$, the norm of $P$ is of the form $NP = q^{\deg(P)}$, where the degree of a point is $\deg(P) := [\kappa(P): k]$. Thus, it makes sense to rewrite the zeta function in terms of the variable $T := q^{-s}$. We write $$Z(X, T) := \prod_P \left( 1 - T^{\deg P}\right)^{-1}.$$<blockquote><p><strong>Proposition</strong> (Exponential form). Let $X$ be a variety over $k$. Then, $Z(X, 0) = 1$ and $$Z(X,T) = \exp \left( \sum_{r=1}^\infty |X(\mathbf{F}_{q^r})|\frac{T^r}{r} \right).$$</blockquote><p><strong>Remark:</strong> Recall that when $X$ is a variety over a field $k$, a degree $d$ closed point of $X$ corresponds to an orbit of $X(\bar{k})$ under the action of the absolute Galois group $G_k := \mathrm{Gal}(\bar{k}/k)$ of size $d$.<p>From the remark above, one deduces that $|X(k_r)|$ is equal to $\sum_{d|r} d N_d$, where $N_d$ denotes the number of degree-$d$ closed points on $X$. The proof of the Proposition follows by applying this formula to the generating series inside of the exponential, changing the order of the sum, and using the Taylor series expansion of $\log(1-x)$.<h1 id=the-weil-conjectures>The Weil conjectures</h1><p>You might have noticed that in all of our examples of varieties over finite fields, the zeta function turns out to be a rational function with rational coefficients. This is the first of four remarkable conjectures proposed by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil>André Weil</a>.<blockquote><p><strong>Theorem</strong> (The Weil conjectures) Let $X$ be a variety over $ k = \mathbf{F}_q$.<ol><li><em>(Rationality)</em> $Z_X(T)$ is the Taylor series of a rational function $$\dfrac{(1-\beta_1T)\cdots(1-\beta_sT)}{(1-\alpha_1T)\cdots(1-\alpha_rT)} \in \mathbf{Q}(T).$$<li><em>(Riemann hypothesis)</em> If $X$ is smooth and projective of dimension $d$, then $$Z_X(T) = \dfrac{P_1(T)P_3(T)\cdots P_{2d-1}(T)}{P_0(T)P_2(T)\cdots P_{2d}(T)},$$ where each $P_i(T) \in 1 + T\mathbf{Z}[T]$ factors over $\mathbf{C}$ as $$P_i(T) = \prod_{j = 1}^{b_i}(1-\alpha_{ij}T),$$ and the roots satisfy $|\alpha_{ij}| = q^{i/2}$.<li><em>(Functional equation)</em> In addition, for $X$ smooth and projective of dimension $d$ $$Z_X\left(\frac{1}{q^dT}\right) = \pm q^{d\chi/2}T^\chi Z_X(T),$$ where $\chi = b_0 - b_1 + b_2 - \cdots + b_{2d}$ is the Euler characteristic of $X$. If $X$ is geometrically irreducible, then $P_0(T) = (1-T)$ and $P_{2d}(T) = 1 - q^dT$.<li><em>(Singular Cohomology)</em> Suppose $K$ is a number field. Fix an embedding $K \hookrightarrow \mathbf{C}$. Let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension $d$ over $K$. Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime of $K$ for which $X$ has good reduction. Then, each $b_i = b_i(X_\mathfrak{p})$ equals the rank of the singular cohomology group $H^i(X(\mathbf{C}), \mathbf{Z})$.</ol></blockquote><p>The connection with singular cohomology is especially surprising; it hints a relationship between the topology of complex manifolds and the number of solutions to polynomial equations over finite fields. For example, if $X$ is a nice genus $g$ curve defined over the rationals, the set $X(\mathbf{C})$ of complex points is a compact Riemann surface (a donut with $g$ holes) whose Betti numbers are $$h^0(X(\mathbf{C}), \mathbf{Z}) = 1, \quad h^1(X(\mathbf{C}), \mathbf{Z}) = 2g, \quad h^2(X(\mathbf{C}), \mathbf{Z}) = 1.$$ Furthermore, if $p$ is a prime of good reduction (reducing the coefficients of the equation defining $X$ $\mathrm{mod} ~ p$ gives a nice curve $X_p$ defined over $\mathbf{F}_p$), then we have that $$Z(X_p, T) = \dfrac{P_1(X_p, T)}{(1-T)(1-pT)},$$ where $$ \deg (1-T) = 1, \quad \deg P_1(X_p, T) = 2g, \quad \deg (1-pT) = 1.$$<p>Taking the elliptic curve (genus $g=1$) $E$ with affine equation $y^2 + y = x^3 - x$, <a href=https://www.lmfdb.org/EllipticCurve/Q/37/a/1>LMFDB label 37.a1</a>, and discriminant $37$.

Schmidt</a> proved these statements for curves, except for the Riemann hypothesis, which was proved by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmut_Hasse>Helmut Hasse</a> in the case of elliptic curves and by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Weil>André Weil</a> himself for general curves - using intersection theory on surfaces. Weil also proved his conjectures in the case of abelian varieties.<p>Weil secretly proposed an explanation based on the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lefschetz_fixed-point_theorem>Lefschetz fixed-point theorem</a>. If $M$ is a $d$-dimensional compact real manifold, and $f: M\to M$ is a <em>reasonable map</em>, then the induced maps on singular cohomology $$f^* \colon H^i(M,\mathbf{Q}) \to H^i(M,\mathbf{Q})$$ count the number of fixed points of $f$ via $$\sum_{i=0}^d (-1)^i \mathrm{Tr}\left( f^*|_{H^i(M,\mathbf{Q})}\right).$$<p>For a variety $X$ defined over $k$, we have the $q$-Frobenius $F: X\to X$. The number $|X(k_n)|$ equals the number of fixed points of the $n$-th iteration $F^n$ of the Frobenius endomorphism. This led Weil to suspect that $|X(k_n)|$ should be computable as a similar alternating sum of the trace of $F^n$ acting on some conjectural cohomology groups that would act like singular cohomology, but defined also for algebraic varieties in positive characteristic. (I read somewhere - don't remember where- that Weil predicted the Betti numbers of complex Grassmannians using his conjectures, before topologists could calculate them!)<p>The Rationality part of the conjectures was proved by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Dwork>Bernard Dwork</a> using $p$-adic methods.<p>Finally, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tale_cohomology>étale cohomology</a> was developed by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Artin>Michael Artin</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck>Alexander Grothendieck</a> and others to serve as the conjectural cohomology theory that Weil was looking for. In particular, they proved the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grothendieck_trace_formula>Grothendieck-Lefschetz trace formula</a>, which allowed them to prove all the conjectures except for the Riemann hypothesis.<p>The Riemann hypothesis part was famously proved by <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Deligne>Pierre Deligne</a>, again using étale cohomology. To find references, take a look at the bibliography in <a href=http://www.nieuwarchief.nl/serie5/pdf/naw5-2014-15-3-211.pdf>Oort's article</a> celebrating Deligne's Abel Prize.<h1 id=the-proof-in-dimension-0>The proof in dimension $0$</h1><p>A locally noetherian scheme of dimension 0 is a disjoint union of spectra of Artinian local rings (see <a href=https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0AAX>this lemma</a>). In particular, zero dimensional varieties over $k$ are a finite disjoint union of local Artinian $k$-algebras. For example,<p>\begin{equation} X = \mathrm{Spec} ~ k[t]/(t^2), \end{equation} is a non-reduced zero-dimensional $k$-variety. By Property 1, to calculate the zeta function of $X$ we only need to consider the reduction $X_{\mathrm{red}} = \mathrm{Spec} ~ k$.<p>Therefore, it is enough to prove the conjectures for a point $X = \mathrm{Spec} ~ k_d$, as a $k$-variety. Note that $X$ is smooth, projective, and irreducible (but not geometrically irreducible). We know that $Z(X, T) = P_0(T)^{-1} = (1-T^d)^{-1}$ and the <em>Rationality</em> is clear. The polynomial $P_0(T)$ factors over the complex numbers as $$P_0(T) = \prod_{j=0}^d (1 - \zeta^j T), \quad \alpha_{0,j} := \zeta^j,$$ where $\zeta$ is some primitive $d$-th root of unity. We have that $\chi = b_0 = d$ and the roots satisfy $|\alpha_{0,j}| = q^{0/2} = 1$ for every $j$, so $X$ also satisfies the <em>Riemann hypothesis</em>. The <em>Functional equation</em> is checked directly: $$ Z(X, 1/T) = \dfrac{1}{1 - T^{-d}} = \dfrac{T^d}{T^d-1} =-T^d Z(X,T).$$<p>To verify the <em>Singular cohomology</em> part, let $K\supseteq \mathbf{Q}$ be an algebraic number field, and let $X$ be a smooth projective variety of dimension zero over $K$. Thus, $X = \mathrm{Spec} ~ L$ where $L \supseteq K$ is a finite field extension, say of degree $n$.<blockquote><p><strong>Definition</strong> (Integral model) Let $R$ be an integral domain with field of fractions $K$. Let $X$ be a $K$-scheme. An $R$-<em>model</em> for $X$ is an $R$-scheme $\mathsf{X}$ equiped with a $K$-isomorphism $\mathsf{X}\times_R K \cong X$.</blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>Definition</strong> (Good reduction) Let $R$ be an Dedekind domain with field of fractions $K$. Let $\mathfrak{p}$ be a prime of $K$. A smooth proper $K$-variety $X$ has <em>good reduction at</em> $\mathfrak{p}$, if $X$ admits a smooth proper $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$-model. We say that $X$ has <em>good reduction</em> if it has good reduction at every prime.</blockquote><p>We note that $X = \mathrm{Spec} ~ L$ has good reduction for the primes of $K$ that are unramified on $L$. Indeed, since $L\supseteq K$ is a finite extension, we see that $X \to \mathrm{Spec} ~ K$ is smooth and proper. Let $R, S$ be the rings of integers of $K,L$. For any unramified prime $\mathfrak{p}$ of $K$, consider the $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$-scheme $\mathsf{X} := \mathrm{Spec} ~ S_{\mathfrak{p}}$. The morphism $\mathsf{X} \to \mathrm{Spec} ~ R_{\mathfrak{p}}$ proper since its given by an integral extension of rings. The fact that $\mathfrak{p}$ is unramified implies that it is also smooth (of relative dimension zero), via the <a href=https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/gradnumthy/dedekindf.pdf>Dedekind-Kummer</a> theorem. Furthermore, since $S_{\mathfrak{p}} \otimes_{R_{\mathfrak{p}}} K$ is isomorphic to $L_\mathfrak{p} = L,$ we have that $\mathsf{X}$ is an $R_{\mathfrak{p}}$-model of $X$.<p>One the topology side, we have that the complex points $X(\mathbf{C})$ are in bijective correspondence with the finite set of embeddings $\mathrm{Hom}_K(L, \mathbf{C})$. In particular, $X(\mathbf{C})$ has $n = [L:K]$ elements, and $$h^0(X(\mathbf{C}), \mathbf{Z}) = n.$$<p>On the arithmetic side, we have that $X_\mathfrak{p} = \mathrm{Spec} ~ S/\mathfrak{p}S$ is the special fiber of $\mathsf{X} = \mathrm{Spec} ~ S_{\mathfrak{p}} \to \mathrm{Spec} ~ R_{\mathfrak{p}}$. Looking at the factorization $$\mathfrak{p}S = \prod_i \mathfrak{q}_i,$$<p>we see that $X_\mathfrak{p}$ is a disjoint union of $g$ points, corresponding to the finite fields $S/\mathfrak{q}_i$, which are degree $f_i$ extensions of $R/\mathfrak{p}$. The fundamental identity from algebraic number theory implies that $$\deg P_0(T) = f_1 + ... + f_g = n.$$</section></article></main></div>
